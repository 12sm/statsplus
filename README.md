Additional Stats for CoinStats Portfolios

While there are LOTS of Crypto Portfolio managers out there, I chose to use Coinstats because it allows me to use both a web interface and a mobile interface, making the manual entry of some of my trades much easier. My one gripe has always been their lax calculations (missing TRUE Cost Basis and Net Costs) even at the Pro Level... so, here's this!

How to use this:
1. Download the repo as a Zip.
2. Unpack the Zip to a folder on your computer
3. Load up Chrome and goto chrome://extensions/ to manage your extensions
4. Toggle "Developer Mode" on the top right side.
5. Click "Load Unpacked" on the top left and select your folder
6. Install the extension
7. Login to your CoinStats account via their web interface
8. Visit the /transactions page of any coin you're currently HODLing. 
9. Click the extension in your toolbar to add a Cost Basis and Net Costs calculation to the table header!

You should end up with something like the image below.

*** NOTE: This must be for a single coin, not the all transactions page. If you have more transactions for that coin than can fit on a single page, make sure to click "Load More" at the bottom of the page to load all your relevant transactions before activating the extension.

Hopefully I'll add more calculations as time goes by.
